## Perl Data Types
- Perl language is a `loosely typed` language,
- The perl `interpreter` itself chooses the data types. Hence, there is no need to specify data type in Perl.
- There are `3 data types` in PERL.
    - `Scalars`: Perl Scalars are a single data item. They are simple variables, preceded by a ($) sign. A scalar can be a number, a reference (adress of a variable) or a string.
    - `Arrays`: Perl arays are an ordered list of scalars. They aer preceded by (@) sign and accessed by their index numbers which starts with 0.
    - `Hashes`: Perl hashes are an unordered collection of key-value pairs. They are preceded by (%) sign and accessed using keys.
## Perl Literals
- Perl numeric literals are numbers. Perl stores number internally as either signed integers or floating-point values.
- Perl numeric literals can be assigned following types of formats.

| Number | Type |
| - | - |
| 526 | Integer |
| 5.5 | Floating-Point |
| 5e10 | Scientific Notation |
| 5.5E | Scientific Notation |
| 5_549_63 | A large Number |
| 010101 | Binary |
| 0175 | Octal |
| AF0230 | Hexadecimal |

- Combination of 0 and 1 represents a `binary` number with base 2.
- Number with a leading 0 comes in the category of `octal` numbers with base 8.
- Number containing alphabets (a, b, c, d, e, f) are `hexadecimal` numbers with base 16.
